You are an expert full-stack developer specializing in educational management systems. You will help develop a comprehensive information platform for a city's education bureau, based on the following detailed project specifications. Your task is to generate complete, functional code for both the backend and frontend, following the exact requirements. Do not skip any steps—proceed systematically: first design the database schema, then implement the backend APIs, then the frontend pages, and finally provide setup instructions including Git/SVN configuration.

### Project Overview
This project is titled "City Education Bureau Comprehensive Information Service Platform" under the theme of "Internet + Smart Education." It aims to create a centralized management platform for city-wide educational information systems, aggregating educational big data on a cloud platform. Key features include:
- Implementing electronic class signs, home-school communication (e.g., notifications between parents, teachers, and students), and other functions across all primary and secondary schools in the city.
- Piloting a "one-card" system in selected key schools, enabling intelligent access control, gates, physical cards for attendance, payments, etc.
- Analyzing big data on school layouts, teacher resources, teaching activities, etc., to provide references for city-wide education development planning and administrative policy formulation.
The platform must support multiple user roles: administrators (education bureau staff), school admins, teachers, students, and parents. Ensure security, scalability, and user-friendly interfaces. The system should handle data aggregation, real-time notifications, and analytics dashboards.

### Development Standards and Technologies
- **Process Norms**: Follow CMMI Level 3 (Capability Maturity Model Integration) for process management, emphasizing defined processes, quantitative management, and continuous improvement. Use RUP (Rational Unified Process) for iterative development: Inception (requirements gathering), Elaboration (architecture design), Construction (implementation), Transition (deployment/testing).
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - **Backend**: Use Spring Boot 3.x as the framework. For database operations, use MyBatis-Plus for ORM and simplified CRUD. Database: MySQL 8.x (assume a relational database for student/teacher data, with potential NoSQL extensions for big data if needed, but stick to MySQL for core). Implement RESTful APIs with JWT for authentication. Use Lombok for boilerplate reduction, and include error handling, logging (SLF4J), and validation (Hibernate Validator).
  - **Frontend**: Use Vue.js 3.x with Composition API. UI library: Element Plus for components like tables, forms, dialogs, etc. State management: Pinia. Routing: Vue Router. HTTP client: Axios. Ensure responsive design for desktop and mobile (though mobile APP is mentioned, focus on web-based frontend for now; if needed, suggest Vue-based PWA for mobile).
  - **Other**: 
    - Security: Role-based access control (RBAC) using Spring Security.
    - Data Analysis: Integrate simple charts using ECharts (Vue-compatible) for big data visualizations (e.g., school layout stats, teacher distribution).
    - Cloud Integration: Assume deployment on a cloud platform like Alibaba Cloud or AWS; include basic configurations for data aggregation (e.g., API endpoints for data upload from schools).
    - Source Code Management: Use Git for version control. Provide a .gitignore file. Structure the repo with separate folders for backend and frontend. Alternatively, if SVN is preferred, provide SVN setup commands, but default to Git.
- **General Guidelines**:
  - Code Style: Follow Java conventions for backend (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes). For frontend, use kebab-case for file names, PascalCase for components.
  - Testing: Include unit tests for backend (JUnit 5) and frontend (Vitest or Jest).
  - Documentation: Add Javadoc for backend methods, comments in frontend components. Generate API docs with Swagger/OpenAPI.
  - Performance: Optimize queries with MyBatis-Plus pagination. Handle large data sets (e.g., student records) efficiently.
  - Internationalization: Support Chinese as primary language, but make it extensible.
  - Deployment: Provide Dockerfiles for containerization if possible, but at minimum, include run instructions (e.g., mvn spring-boot:run for backend, npm run dev for frontend).

### Implementation Steps
1. **Database Design**: Create ER diagram (text-based). Schemas for users, schools, students, documents, resources, etc. Use MyBatis-Plus for code gen.
2. **Backend Implementation**: Start with core APIs (auth, users). Then module-by-module. Provide full code in Java.
3. **Frontend Implementation**: Create Vue app structure. Pages for each sub-module (e.g., Login.vue, Dashboard.vue). Use Element Plus components.
4. **Integration & Testing**: Connect frontend to backend. Add sample data.
5. **Repo Setup**: Git init, commit structure. Provide commands.

Generate the code now, module by module, explaining each part. If anything is unclear, assume standard best practices for educational platforms.
